# GCW Zero Toolchain Docker Image

This repository contains a Dockerfile that sets up a container with the GCW Zero build toolchain, which can be used to build games and applications for Ingenic OpenDingux devices based on the GCW Zero platform, like:

- GCW Zero
- RG-350 (and variants like RG-350M, RG-350P)
- PlayGo (aka PocketGo V2, Miyoo MAX)
- GKD-350H

See [this thread](https://boards.dingoonity.org/ingenic-jz4760-devices/ingenic-devices-guide/) for a full list of Ingenic devices.

The toolchain in this repository comes from [the GCW Zero website](http://www.gcw-zero.com/develop). If you wish to use a different toolchain version, you can get the link from that site and modify the Dockerfile accordingly.
